	"description": "NextGen is an Autonomous Building Mod. The NextGen Mod ushers in a new era of strategic gameplay by introducing the concept of autonomous buildings. Traditionally, energy and metal production have been external aspects, with structures requiring a constant supply. However, NextGen challenges this norm. With this mod, buildings transform into self-sufficient entities, capable of generating their own energy and producing metal. This seismic shift in building mechanics introduces a fresh layer of strategic depth to the game. It's important to note, that 100% efficiency remains a myth. Visualize self-powered forts and independent factories as standalone pillars of resistance. Each building becomes a strategic choice, with each placement either a step towards or away from self-sufficiency. Your gameplay will no longer be solely about conquest, but also about the art of sustainable development in an interplanetary war. NextGen is not just another mod, it's an evolution, a leap into the future of Planetary Annihilation: Titans. It challenges players to adapt to new mechanics, pushing the boundaries of their strategic thinking and planning.",
